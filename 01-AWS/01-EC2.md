### ✅ **Basic EC2 Interview Questions**

1. **What is EC2 in AWS?**
   *EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a virtual server in the AWS cloud. It allows users to run scalable computing capacity.*

2. **What are EC2 instance types?**
   *General Purpose (t2, t3), Compute Optimized (c5), Memory Optimized (r5), Storage Optimized (i3), and GPU instances (p3, g4).*

3. **What is the difference between `stop` and `terminate` an EC2 instance?**

   * *Stop*: Instance shuts down and can be started again; volume data is preserved.
   * *Terminate*: Instance is deleted, along with all attached resources (unless EBS is set to "retain").\*

4. **What is an AMI?**
   *Amazon Machine Image is a template that contains a software configuration (OS, app server, apps) for launching EC2 instances.*

5. **How do you connect to an EC2 instance?**
   *Using SSH with a private key: `ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@public-ip`*

### ✅ **Intermediate EC2 Interview Questions**

6. **What are security groups in EC2?**
   *Virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic for instances.*

7. **How to resize an EC2 instance?**
   *Stop the instance → Change instance type → Start the instance again.*

8. **What is the difference between EBS and Instance Store?**

   * *EBS*: Persistent block storage that can be detached/reattached.
   * *Instance Store*: Temporary storage that is lost when the instance is stopped or terminated.

9. **What is EC2 User Data?**
   *A script that runs on the first boot of the instance. Commonly used for installing packages.*

10. **Can you attach one EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances?**
    *Yes, using EBS Multi-Attach (only for io1/io2 volumes with limited use cases).*

### ✅ **Advanced EC2 Interview Questions**

11. **Explain EC2 Spot, Reserved, and On-Demand instances.**

* *On-Demand*: Pay per hour/second.
* *Reserved*: 1 or 3 year commitment with discounts.
* *Spot*: Bidding-based pricing — cheapest but can be interrupted anytime.

12. **How do you automate EC2 instance backup?**
    *Use AWS Data Lifecycle Manager or create snapshots via Lambda/CloudWatch Events.*

13. **What is EC2 Hibernate state?**
    *Preserves RAM content — useful for long-running processes that need fast resume.*

14. **How do you handle high availability for EC2-based web apps?**
    *Use Load Balancers (ALB/ELB) + Auto Scaling Groups across multiple Availability Zones.*

15. **How can you secure your EC2 instances?**

* Use IAM roles for EC2
* Only allow required inbound ports
* Use SSM instead of SSH
* Store secrets in AWS Secrets Manager

### ✅ **Scenario-Based EC2 Interview Questions**

16. **You need to deploy 100 EC2 instances. How would you automate this?**

* Use Auto Scaling Groups with Launch Templates
* Use Terraform/CloudFormation for infrastructure as code

17. **You’ve attached a volume, but it’s not showing in `df -h`. Why?**
    *It must be formatted and mounted manually using `mkfs` and `mount`.*

18. **Your EC2 instance becomes unreachable. How would you troubleshoot?**

* Check if instance is in running state
* Review security group rules and network ACLs
* Use EC2 Serial Console or Session Manager
* Check system logs via the EC2 dashboard

19. **What would you do if the root EBS volume is full?**

* Stop the instance
* Take a snapshot
* Create a larger volume from snapshot
* Attach and replace the root volume

20. **How do you restrict developers from accessing EC2 but allow automation tools?**

* Create separate IAM roles
* Use policies to allow access only through tools like Terraform or Jenkins via specific conditions
