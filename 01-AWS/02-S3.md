## ðŸ”¹ **Basic AWS S3 Interview Questions**

### 1. **What is Amazon S3?**

**Answer:**
Amazon S3 is an object storage service that provides industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. It stores data as objects in buckets.

---

### 2. **What is a bucket in S3?**

**Answer:**
A bucket is a container for storing objects (files). You must create a bucket before you can store data in Amazon S3.

---

### 3. **What types of storage classes are available in S3?**

**Answer:**

* S3 Standard
* S3 Intelligent-Tiering
* S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)
* S3 One Zone-IA
* S3 Glacier
* S3 Glacier Deep Archive
* S3 Reduced Redundancy (deprecated)

## ðŸ”¹ **Intermediate AWS S3 Interview Questions**

### 4. **What is the maximum file size you can store in S3?**

**Answer:**

* Maximum single upload: **5GB**
* Maximum object size via multipart upload: **5TB**

---

### 5. **Explain S3 versioning.**

**Answer:**
S3 Versioning keeps multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. Useful for recovery from accidental deletes or overwrites. When enabled, every PUT creates a new version.

---

### 6. **How do S3 bucket policies work?**

**Answer:**
Bucket policies are resource-based JSON permissions applied to the entire bucket. They define who can access the bucket and what actions they can perform.

---

### 7. **What is S3 Lifecycle Policy?**

**Answer:**
It automates transitions (e.g., Standard â†’ Glacier) and expiration of objects based on rules. Used for cost optimization and data lifecycle management.

## ðŸ”¹ **Advanced AWS S3 Interview Questions**

### 8. **How does S3 ensure durability and availability?**

**Answer:**
S3 offers **99.999999999% (11 9â€™s)** durability by redundantly storing objects across multiple Availability Zones (AZs). High availability is ensured via replication and automatic failover.

---

### 9. **How does multipart upload work?**

**Answer:**
Multipart upload divides large objects into parts, uploads them in parallel, then assembles them. It increases upload efficiency and fault tolerance for large files.

---

### 10. **What is S3 Select and when is it used?**

**Answer:**
S3 Select allows you to retrieve a subset of data from an object using SQL-like queries â€” useful when dealing with large CSV, JSON, or Parquet files.

---

### 11. **How do you secure S3 buckets?**

**Answer:**

* Enable **Bucket Policies** or **IAM Policies**
* Turn on **MFA Delete**
* Use **S3 Block Public Access**
* Enable **Server-Side Encryption (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C)**
* Enable **VPC Endpoints for S3**
* Enable **Access Logs & CloudTrail**

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Scenario-Based Questions**

### 12. **Scenario: You need to host a static website on S3. How will you proceed?**

**Answer:**

1. Create an S3 bucket named the same as the domain.
2. Enable static website hosting in bucket properties.
3. Upload website files (index.html, error.html).
4. Make objects public using a bucket policy.
5. (Optional) Use Route53 + CloudFront for custom domain & HTTPS.

---

### 13. **Scenario: Your S3 bucket objects are being deleted accidentally. How can you prevent this?**

**Answer:**

* Enable **Versioning** to recover deleted objects.
* Enable **MFA Delete** to add a layer of protection for deletions.
* Add **IAM policies** to restrict delete access.
* Audit with **AWS CloudTrail** logs.

---

### 14. **Scenario: Your data stored in S3 is accessed frequently and also used for analytics. How will you optimize cost and performance?**

**Answer:**

* Use **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** for auto cost optimization.
* Use **S3 Select** for efficient querying.
* Use **Athena** if running large queries on S3 data.

---

### 15. **Scenario: How to automate backup of EC2 logs to S3 daily?**

**Answer:**

* Write a **cron job or shell script** using AWS CLI on EC2:

```bash
aws s3 cp /var/log/myapp.log s3://mybucket/logs/ --recursive
```

* Use **IAM role** with necessary `s3:PutObject` permissions.
* (Optional) Use **AWS Data Lifecycle Manager** or **S3 lifecycle rules** to archive logs.

---

### âœ… **Basic IAM Interview Questions and Answers**

1. **What is IAM in AWS?**
   IAM stands for Identity and Access Management. It allows you to securely control access to AWS services and resources for users.

2. **What are IAM users, groups, and roles?**

   * **User**: An individual identity with credentials.
   * **Group**: A collection of users with common permissions.
   * **Role**: A temporary identity with policies, assumed by users or services.

3. **What are IAM policies?**
   Policies are JSON documents that define permissions. They are attached to users, groups, or roles to control access.

4. **How do you enforce MFA in IAM?**
   Attach an IAM policy requiring `aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent` condition or use IAM Identity Center (formerly SSO).
