## üü¢ **Basic ECS Interview Questions**

1. **What is ECS in AWS?**

   * ECS (Elastic Container Service) is a fully managed container orchestration service that allows you to run and scale containerized applications.

2. **What are the two ECS launch types?**

   * EC2 Launch Type
   * Fargate Launch Type

3. **What is a Task Definition?**

   * It‚Äôs a blueprint for your application describing containers, CPU/memory, networking, etc.

4. **What is a Task and a Service in ECS?**

   * Task: An instance of a Task Definition running on ECS.
   * Service: Maintains a desired number of task instances.

5. **Difference between Fargate and EC2 Launch type?**

   * **Fargate**: Serverless, AWS manages infrastructure.
   * **EC2**: You manage the EC2 instances hosting containers.

## üü° **Intermediate ECS Interview Questions**

6. **How does ECS handle scaling?**

   * Using **Auto Scaling Groups** for EC2 and **Service Auto Scaling** for ECS services.

7. **What is a Cluster in ECS?**

   * Logical grouping of tasks or services.

8. **How to persist logs in ECS?**

   * Configure `awslogs` driver to push logs to CloudWatch.

9. **What networking modes are supported by ECS?**

   * Bridge, Host, awsvpc, None.

10. **How do you update a running ECS service?**

* Use `update-service` command or via AWS Console to deploy new Task Definition.

11. **How do IAM roles work with ECS?**

* ECS Task Role: Assigned to tasks for AWS resource access.
* ECS Execution Role: Required to pull images and write logs.

## üî¥ **Advanced ECS Interview Questions**

12. **What is the use of ECS Capacity Providers?**

* Helps define how tasks are placed on Fargate/EC2 and how to scale infrastructure.

13. **Difference between ECS and EKS?**

* ECS: AWS-native container orchestration.
* EKS: Managed Kubernetes service on AWS.

14. **How do you troubleshoot ECS deployment failure?**

* Use:

  * CloudWatch logs
  * `describe-tasks` for container errors
  * ECS events and Service Health
  * Task exit codes

15. **Can you use custom Docker images in ECS?**

* Yes, ECS can pull images from ECR or Docker Hub.

16. **How does ECS integrate with ALB?**

* ECS service can register tasks directly with the target group of ALB.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Scenario-Based ECS Interview Questions**

17. **Your ECS task keeps restarting. How do you debug it?**

* Check:

  * CloudWatch logs
  * Exit code
  * Task definition resource limits (memory, CPU)
  * Container health checks

18. **How to deploy a multi-container app using ECS?**

* Use a single Task Definition with multiple container definitions.

19. **How to run one-time jobs in ECS?**

* Run Task manually or schedule with CloudWatch Event.

20. **How do you set up Blue/Green deployments in ECS?**

* Use **CodeDeploy** with ECS and an ALB to switch traffic gradually.

21. **How to isolate environments (dev/test/prod) in ECS?**

* Use separate ECS clusters or services with different VPC/subnet/Task Definitions.

## üß™ Useful ECS CLI Commands

```bash
# Register Task Definition
aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://task-def.json

# Run a task
aws ecs run-task --cluster my-cluster --task-definition my-task

# Update service
aws ecs update-service --cluster my-cluster --service my-service --task-definition new-task

# List tasks
aws ecs list-tasks --cluster my-cluster

# Describe task
aws ecs describe-tasks --cluster my-cluster --tasks task-id
```
