## ‚úÖ **1. General Cloud Compliance Questions (All Frameworks)**

### Q1. What is cloud compliance?

**Answer:** Cloud compliance refers to the practice of ensuring that cloud computing services comply with regulatory standards and frameworks like PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2, etc., by leveraging proper controls in data storage, access, encryption, monitoring, and audit logging.

### Q2. How does AWS help with regulatory compliance?

**Answer:** AWS provides tools like:

* **AWS Artifact** ‚Äì On-demand access to AWS compliance reports (SOC, PCI, ISO, etc.)
* **AWS Config** ‚Äì Track and audit configuration changes
* **AWS CloudTrail** ‚Äì Records API calls for auditing
* **AWS Security Hub** ‚Äì Central view of security & compliance status
* **AWS Organizations & SCPs** ‚Äì Enforce guardrails for multi-account security
