## ðŸš€ **Ansible Interview Questions and Answers**

---

### ðŸ§© **Basic Ansible Interview Questions**

---

#### 1. **What is Ansible?**

**Answer:**
Ansible is an open-source automation tool for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It uses **SSH** and **YAML-based playbooks**.

---

#### 2. **What language is used to write Ansible playbooks?**

**Answer:**
**YAML (Yet Another Markup Language)**

---

#### 3. **Is Ansible agent-based or agentless?**

**Answer:**
**Agentless** â€“ it uses **SSH** or **WinRM** to connect to nodes.

---

#### 4. **What are the components of Ansible?**

* **Inventory** â€“ List of target hosts
* **Modules** â€“ Units of work (e.g., `yum`, `copy`, `file`)
* **Playbooks** â€“ YAML file describing automation tasks
* **Tasks** â€“ Actual work inside a playbook
* **Roles** â€“ Reusable collections of tasks
* **Facts** â€“ System info collected from nodes
* **Handlers** â€“ Triggered tasks on conditions

---

#### 5. **How do you run a simple ad-hoc command in Ansible?**

```bash
ansible all -m ping
```

---

#### 6. **What is the Ansible inventory file?**

**Answer:**
A file that lists all the target nodes (hosts) for playbooks. Example:

```ini
[webservers]
server1 ansible_host=192.168.1.100
```

---

#### 7. **What are modules in Ansible?**

**Answer:**
Modules are predefined units of code that do a specific task (e.g., `file`, `copy`, `service`, `yum`).

---

#### 8. **What is the difference between `play` and `task`?**

* **Play**: A group of tasks for a host/group
* **Task**: A single unit of action

---

#### 9. **How do you check the syntax of a playbook?**

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --syntax-check
```

---

#### 10. **How do you run an Ansible playbook?**

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory
```

---

### ðŸ§ª **Intermediate Ansible Interview Questions**

---

#### 11. **What are variables in Ansible and where can you define them?**

**Answer:**
Variables can be defined in:

* `vars` section of playbook
* Inventory file
* Host/group vars directories
* Role defaults/vars
* Extra vars (`--extra-vars`)

---

#### 12. **What are facts in Ansible?**

**Answer:**
Facts are system details (OS, IP, memory, etc.) automatically gathered with the `setup` module.

---

#### 13. **How do you disable fact gathering?**

```yaml
gather_facts: no
```

---

#### 14. **How do you pass extra variables at runtime?**

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml -e "version=1.2.3"
```

---

#### 15. **What is a role in Ansible?**

**Answer:**
A structured way to organize playbooks using folders: `tasks/`, `vars/`, `defaults/`, `handlers/`, etc.

---

#### 16. **What is a handler in Ansible?**

**Answer:**
A handler is a task triggered only when notified. Used for conditional actions like restarting services.

---

#### 17. **How do you reuse playbooks or tasks?**

* Include tasks: `include_tasks`, `import_tasks`
* Use roles

---

#### 18. **What is idempotency in Ansible?**

**Answer:**
Idempotency ensures that applying the same playbook multiple times doesn't change the system after the first run.

---

#### 19. **What is Ansible Vault?**

**Answer:**
It encrypts sensitive data like passwords or API keys in playbooks.

```bash
ansible-vault encrypt secrets.yml

**Answer:**
An external script or plugin (e.g., AWS EC2 plugin) that generates inventory dynamically.

---

#### 23. **How do you conditionally execute tasks?**

```yaml
when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian'
```

---

#### 24. **How do you loop over tasks?**

```

---

#### 27. **What is the difference between `include_tasks` and `import_tasks`?**

## âœ… **1. Basic Ansible Interview Questions**

### Q1. What is Ansible?

**Answer:**
Ansible is an open-source automation tool for configuration management, application deployment, orchestration, and provisioning using SSH and YAML-based playbooks.

---

### Q2. What language is used to write Ansible playbooks?

**Answer:**
YAML (YAML Ainâ€™t Markup Language)

---

### Q3. How does Ansible work?

**Answer:**
Ansible uses SSH to communicate with remote machines and pushes configurations via modules defined in playbooks. It is agentless and uses an inventory file to manage nodes.

---

### Q4. What is an inventory file?

**Answer:**
A file that lists the IPs or hostnames of machines that Ansible manages. It can be static or dynamic.

---

### Q5. What are modules in Ansible?

**Answer:**
Modules are units of work like `copy`, `yum`, `service`, `file`, `shell`, etc., used in playbooks to execute tasks.

---

## ðŸ”· **2. Intermediate Level Questions**

### Q6. What is a playbook in Ansible?

**Answer:**
A playbook is a YAML file containing one or more "plays" that define the tasks and roles to be executed on target hosts.

---

### Q7. What are roles in Ansible?

**Answer:**
Roles are a way to organize playbooks into reusable components. They contain tasks, variables, handlers, templates, and files.

---

### Q8. What is the difference between `vars`, `defaults`, and `extra_vars`?

**Answer:**

* `defaults` (lowest precedence)
* `vars` (in playbooks or roles)
* `extra_vars` (passed via command line) â€“ **highest precedence**

---

### Q9. How do you handle secrets in Ansible?

**Answer:**
Using **Ansible Vault** to encrypt sensitive data like passwords or keys:

```bash
ansible-vault encrypt secrets.yml
```

---

### Q10. What is a handler in Ansible?

**Answer:**
Handlers are tasks triggered by `notify` when something changes. Commonly used for restarting services after config updates.

---

## ðŸ”¶ **3. Advanced Questions**

### Q11. How do you debug a failing Ansible playbook?

**Answer:**

* Use `ansible-playbook -vvv playbook.yml` for verbose output
* Use the `debug` module in tasks
* Check `register` variables for command output
* Use `block/rescue/always` for exception handling

---

### Q12. How to register output of a task and use it in the next task?

**Answer:**

```yaml
- name: Get hostname
  command: hostname
  register: result

- name: Print hostname
  debug:
    msg: "The hostname is {{ result.stdout }}"
```

---

### Q13. What is the difference between `include_tasks`, `import_tasks`, and `include_role`?

**Answer:**

* `import_tasks`: Static import; evaluated at playbook parse time.
* `include_tasks`: Dynamic import; evaluated at runtime.
* `include_role`: Dynamically include a role.

---

### Q14. What are facts in Ansible?

**Answer:**
Facts are system properties gathered by Ansible like OS, IP, memory, etc. You can disable fact gathering using:

```yaml
gather_facts: false
```

---

### Q15. Explain Ansible pull mode.

**Answer:**
Instead of pushing configs from a control node, the target machine pulls configs from a Git repository using `ansible-pull`.

---

## ðŸŸ£ **4. Real-Time Scenario-Based Questions**

### Q16. You deployed a config change to 50 servers, but 10 failed. How do you retry?

**Answer:**
Use Ansible's `--limit @/path/to/last_failed.retry` to re-run the playbook on failed hosts.

---

### Q17. How do you loop through a list of users to create accounts?

**Answer:**

```yaml
when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian'
```

---

### Q19. A service restart breaks in production, how do you prevent playbook from stopping?

**Answer:**
Use `ignore_errors: yes` or `block/rescue`.

```yaml
- block:

      service:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted
  rescue:
    - name: Notify team
      debug:
        msg: "Service restart failed"
```

---

### Q20. How do you find which task caused the failure in a big playbook?

**Answer:**

* Use `tags` and run selective tasks.
* Use `--start-at-task="task name"`.

```yaml
{{ my_var | default('default_value') }}
```

---

### Error: `"Failed to connect to the host via ssh"`

**Fix:**

* Check SSH access
* Update inventory file
* Use `ansible_user`, `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` if needed
