### üß© **Basic Git Interview Questions and Answers**

#### 1. **What is Git?**

**Answer:** Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously.

---

#### 2. **What‚Äôs the difference between Git and GitHub?**

**Answer:**

* Git: A version control system installed locally to track code changes.
* GitHub: A cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories that allows collaboration.

---

#### 3. **What is a Git repository?**

**Answer:** A repository is a directory or storage space where your project files and version history are stored. It can be local or remote (e.g., on GitHub).

---

#### 4. **How do you initialize a Git repo?**

```bash
git init
```

Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

---

#### 5. **What is the difference between `git add` and `git commit`?**

* `git add`: Stages changes to be committed.
* `git commit`: Records the staged changes permanently in the repository.

---

#### 6. **How to check the current status of your Git repo?**

```bash
git status
```

---

#### 7. **How to view commit history?**

```bash
git log
```

---

#### 8. **What does `git clone` do?**

**Answer:** It copies a remote repository to your local machine.

---

---

### üß™ **Intermediate Git Interview Questions and Answers**

#### 11. **What is the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`?**

* `git pull`: Fetches and merges changes from remote.
* `git fetch`: Only fetches changes, does not merge.

---

#### 12. **What is a merge conflict?**

**Answer:** It occurs when two branches have changes in the same part of the file and Git doesn‚Äôt know which version to keep.

---

#### 13. **How do you resolve a merge conflict?**

* Open the conflicting file
* Decide what to keep/remove
* Mark it as resolved:

```bash
git add <filename>
git commit
```

---

#### 14. **How do you undo the last commit?**

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1    # Keep changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1    # Remove changes
```

---

#### 15. **What is the staging area in Git?**

**Answer:** It's where changes are placed using `git add` before they are committed.

---

#### 16. **How do you stash changes?**

```bash
git stash
```

Temporarily shelves changes for later use.

---

#### 17. **How to apply a stashed change?**

---

### üîß **Advanced Git Interview Questions and Answers**

#### 21. **What is Git Rebase and how is it different from Merge?**

**Answer:**

* `git rebase`: Moves or replays your changes on top of another branch (linear history).
* `git merge`: Combines histories from different branches (may create merge commits).

---

#### 22. **What is a detached HEAD in Git?**

**Answer:** It means you are not on a branch, but on a specific commit. Changes made won't belong to any branch unless explicitly assigned.

---

#### 23. **How do you cherry-pick a commit from another branch?**

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

---

#### 24. **What is `.gitkeep`?**

* Force push the cleaned history:

```bash
git push origin --force --all
```

---

#### 32. **Scenario: Your teammate pushed broken code to `main`. What do you do?**

**Answer:**

* Revert the specific commit:

```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

* Or use branch protection to avoid direct push next time.

---

#### 33. **Scenario: You need to test a fix without committing your current work.**

**Answer:**

---

#### 38. **Scenario: Someone force pushed and broke history. What do you do?**

**Answer:**

* Use `reflog` to find previous commits.
* Create a new branch and recover.

---

#### 39. **Scenario: You want to share part of a repo without the entire codebase.**

**Answer:**

* Use `git subtree` or `git filter-repo` to extract and share a directory as a new repo.

---

#### 40. **Scenario: Your commit email is incorrect. How to change it retroactively?**

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~n
# Amend each commit or use filter-branch:
git filter-branch --commit-filter '
if [ "$GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL" = "wrong@example.com" ];
then
    GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="Correct Name";
    GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="correct@example.com";

## ‚úÖ **Git Interview Questions and Answers (Including Hooks)**

> Covers: Basics ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Scenarios ‚Üí Hooks

---

### üß© **Basic Git Questions**

Already covered in detail \[see previous message], but here are some hook-related entries to introduce the concept:

#### üîπ 11. **What are Git Hooks?**

**Answer:**
Git Hooks are scripts that run automatically at specific points in the Git lifecycle ‚Äî for example, before a commit or after a push. They‚Äôre stored in the `.git/hooks` directory.

---

### üß™ **Intermediate Questions (Hooks Included)**

#### üîπ 21. **What are common types of Git hooks?**

| Hook Name            | Trigger Time          | Purpose                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `pre-commit`         | Before commit         | Lint checks, run tests, format code   |
| `prepare-commit-msg` | Before message editor | Auto-add ticket number to commit msg  |
| `commit-msg`         | After msg written     | Validate commit message format        |
| `pre-push`           | Before pushing code   | Run tests, prevent push if failing    |
| `post-merge`         | After merge           | Rebuild dependencies or notify system |

---

#### üîπ 22. **Where are hooks stored?**

**Answer:** In every Git repository at:

```
.git/hooks/
```

These are local and not shared by default.

---

#### üîπ 23. **How to enable a hook?**

**Answer:** Remove the `.sample` extension from any hook and make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

---

#### üîπ 24. **Can you share hooks across teams?**

**Answer:** Yes, but not directly through `.git/hooks`. Instead, use tools like:

* **Husky** (JavaScript-based projects)
* **lefthook** (language-agnostic)
* Include hook scripts in a versioned folder and symlink them.

---

### üîß **Advanced Git + Hooks Questions**

#### üîπ 31. **How can hooks be used in CI/CD pipelines?**

**Answer:** Hooks can run local pre-checks before pushing to CI, e.g., formatting or security scanning. In pipelines, custom hook scripts can be embedded in GitLab/GitHub CI to enforce policies before merges.

---

#### üîπ 32. **What is the difference between client-side and server-side hooks?**

| Type        | Location      | Examples                      |
| ----------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Client-side | `.git/hooks/` | `pre-commit`, `pre-push`      |
| Server-side | On Git server | `pre-receive`, `post-receive` |

**Example:** Server-side hooks reject bad pushes on GitHub Enterprise or GitLab.

---

#### üîπ 33. **Write a simple `pre-commit` hook to prevent commits with TODO comments**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
if grep -rnw 'TODO' .; then
  echo "‚ùå Commit blocked: TODOs found"
  exit 1
fi
```

---

#### üîπ 34. **How do you enforce commit message standards using hooks?**

Create a `commit-msg` hook:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
MSG=$(cat $1)
if ! echo "$MSG" | grep -qE "^(feat|fix|docs|refactor):"; then
  echo "‚ùå Invalid commit message. Use conventional format!"
  exit 1
fi
```

---

### üß† **Scenario-Based Git + Hooks Questions**

#### üîπ 41. **Scenario: You want to ensure every developer runs lint before committing.**

**Solution:**

* Create a `pre-commit` hook that runs `eslint` or a linter
* Share via Husky or symlinks in the repo

---

#### üîπ 42. **Scenario: You want to block pushes to `main` unless tests pass.**

**Solution:**
Use a `pre-push` hook:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
npm test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Tests failed. Push rejected."
  exit 1
fi
```

---

#### üîπ 43. **Scenario: How do you enforce commit message policy across an organization?**

**Solution:**

* Use `commit-msg` hook locally (can be installed via Husky).
* Or use server-side hooks (e.g., GitHub Actions or GitLab push rules).

---

#### üîπ 44. **Scenario: How to keep all contributors using the same Git hooks?**

**Solution:**

1. Store hooks in `/hooks/` folder.
2. Add a setup script:

```bash
ln -s ../../hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

3. Automate using Husky or Makefile.

---

#### üîπ 45. **Scenario: You want to auto-install Git hooks after cloning.**

**Solution:**
Add a `post-checkout` or install script in `package.json` or CI setup to run:

```bash
npm run setup-hooks
```

---
