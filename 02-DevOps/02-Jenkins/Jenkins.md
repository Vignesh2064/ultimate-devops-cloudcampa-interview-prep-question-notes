## ðŸš€ **Jenkins Interview Questions and Answers**

---

### ðŸ§© **Basic Jenkins Interview Questions**

#### 1. **What is Jenkins?**

**Answer:** Jenkins is an open-source automation server used to automate parts of the software development process, including building, testing, and deploying code.

---

#### 2. **What are the main features of Jenkins?**

* Open-source and free
* Wide plugin ecosystem
* Supports CI/CD
* Distributed builds using master-slave architecture
* Easy integration with tools like Git, Maven, Docker, etc.

---

#### 3. **What is a Jenkins pipeline?**

**Answer:** A pipeline is a suite of Jenkins jobs that are chained and integrated into a continuous delivery process, defined as code (usually in a `Jenkinsfile`).

---

#### 4. **What are the types of Jenkins pipelines?**

* Declarative pipeline
* Scripted pipeline

---

#### 5. **What is a Jenkinsfile?**

**Answer:** A text file that defines the pipeline and is stored in the source control repository.

---

#### 6. **What is a plugin in Jenkins?**

**Answer:** Plugins extend Jenkins' functionality (e.g., Git, Docker, Slack, SonarQube, etc.).

---

#### 7. **What is the difference between freestyle and pipeline jobs?**

| Freestyle Job            | Pipeline Job                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| GUI-based, limited logic | Code-defined, supports complex logic |
| Less reusable            | Easily reusable and versioned        |

---

### ðŸ§ª **Intermediate Jenkins Interview Questions**

#### 8. **What is Continuous Integration in Jenkins?**

**Answer:** Continuous Integration involves automatically building and testing code on every commit to ensure that the new code doesn't break anything.

---

#### 9. **How do you trigger Jenkins jobs automatically?**

* SCM Polling
* Webhooks (GitHub/GitLab)
* Cron schedules
* Trigger from another job

---

#### 10. **How do you secure Jenkins?**

* Enable authentication (LDAP, SSO, etc.)
* Role-based access control (RBAC)
* Secure Jenkinsfiles (no hardcoded secrets)
* Configure CSRF protection
* Restrict script execution in Groovy sandbox

---

#### 11. **What are agents/nodes in Jenkins?**

**Answer:** Agents are machines (or containers) that run Jenkins jobs. The main Jenkins instance is called the "master" (or controller), and agents perform build tasks.

---

#### 12. **How do you share artifacts between stages or jobs?**

* Use `stash/unstash` in pipelines
* Use `archiveArtifacts` and `copyArtifacts` plugins
* Store in shared locations (e.g., S3, Nexus)

---

#### 13. **What is the use of `post` block in Declarative Pipeline?**

**Answer:** Defines actions to run after the pipeline, such as:

```groovy
post {
  success { echo 'Success!' }
  failure { echo 'Failed!' }
}
```

---

#### 14. **What is the difference between `when` and `input` in a pipeline?**

* `when`: Conditional execution
* `input`: Manual approval to proceed

---

### ðŸ”§ **Advanced Jenkins Interview Questions**

#### 15. **Explain Blue Ocean in Jenkins.**

**Answer:** Blue Ocean is a modern UI plugin for Jenkins that visualizes pipeline execution in a more intuitive and user-friendly way.

---

#### 16. **How do you handle secrets in Jenkins?**

* Use **Credentials Plugin**
* Inject into jobs with `withCredentials`

```groovy
withCredentials([string(credentialsId: 'AWS_SECRET', variable: 'AWS_SECRET_KEY')]) {
    sh 'echo $AWS_SECRET_KEY'
}
```

---

#### 17. **How do you implement parallel stages in Jenkins?**

```groovy
stage('Parallel Test') {
  parallel {
    stage('Unit Test') {
      steps { sh 'run-unit-tests.sh' }
    }
    stage('Integration Test') {
      steps { sh 'run-integration-tests.sh' }
    }
  }
}
```

---

#### 18. **How do you promote builds in Jenkins?**

* Use the **Build Promotion plugin**
* Or custom logic using parameters, approval gates, and artifact transfer

---

#### 19. **What is the difference between Declarative and Scripted pipeline?**

| Declarative         | Scripted                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Simpler syntax      | Full Groovy scripting    |
| Limited flexibility | Fully customizable       |
| Easier for teams    | Better for complex logic |

---

#### 20. **How to create reusable pipeline templates in Jenkins?**

* Use **Shared Libraries**

```groovy
@Library('my-shared-library') _
myPipelineSteps.runTests()
```

---

### ðŸŽ¯ **Scenario-Based Jenkins Questions (Real-Time)**

#### âœ… Scenario 1: *Trigger a build when a developer pushes to GitHub*

**Solution:**

* Set up **webhook** in GitHub
* In Jenkins:

```groovy
triggers {
  githubPush()
}
```

---

#### âœ… Scenario 2: *Fail a build if code coverage < 80%*

**Solution:**

* Integrate with tools like **JaCoCo** or **SonarQube**
* In the pipeline:

```groovy
if (coverage < 80) {
  error('Coverage too low')
}
```

---

#### âœ… Scenario 3: *Deploy to staging only after manual approval*

```groovy
stage('Deploy Approval') {
  steps {
    input message: 'Approve deployment?'
  }
}
stage('Deploy') {
  steps {
    sh './deploy.sh'
  }
}
```

---

#### âœ… Scenario 4: *Run different stages on different agents (e.g., Docker builds on Linux, tests on Windows)*

```groovy
stage('Build Docker') {
  agent { label 'linux-docker' }
  steps { sh 'docker build .' }
}
stage('Run UI Tests') {
  agent { label 'windows' }
  steps { bat 'run-ui-tests.bat' }
}
```

---

#### âœ… Scenario 5: *Send Slack notification after build failure*

**Solution:**
Use Slack plugin:

```groovy
post {
  failure {
    slackSend(color: 'danger', message: "Build Failed: ${env.BUILD_URL}")
  }
}
```

---

#### âœ… Scenario 6: *Reuse pipeline logic across projects*

**Solution:** Shared library with `vars/` and `src/` folder:

```groovy
@Library('my-shared-library') _
buildTools.dockerBuild()
```

---

#### âœ… Scenario 7: *Automatically build a matrix of Java versions (8, 11, 17)*

```groovy
matrix {
  axes {
    axis {
      name 'JAVA_VERSION'
      values '8', '11', '17'
    }
  }
  stages {
    stage('Test') {
      steps {
        sh 'java -version'
      }
    }
  }
}
```
